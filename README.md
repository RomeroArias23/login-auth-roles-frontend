Login + Authentication + Roles (Angular Frontend)
=================================================

This project is a **production-style Angular frontend** that demonstrates how authentication and authorization are implemented in real enterprise applications, such as banking or financial platforms.

It consumes a live backend API secured with **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** and supports **role-based access control**.

**Live Demo**[https://romeroarias23.github.io/login-auth-roles-frontend/](https://romeroarias23.github.io/login-auth-roles-frontend/)

Important Note (Please Read)
----------------------------

Authentication tokens are generated by a **live backend hosted on Render (free tier)**.

**The first request may take up to 1 minute** due to cold-start behavior on the backend.Please be patient after clicking **Login** — this is expected and normal.

Once the backend is awake, the application responds instantly.

What This Project Demonstrates
------------------------------

This frontend showcases **real-world Angular patterns**, not toy examples.

### Core Concepts

*   JWT-based authentication
    
*   Role-based authorization
    
*   Protected routes
    
*   HTTP interceptors
    
*   Global error handling
    
*   Secure session management
    
*   Standalone components (Angular 15+)
    
*   Reactive Forms
    
*   Enterprise-ready architecture
    

Demo Users
----------

Use any of the following credentials to test different roles:

| Role     | Username   | Password  |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Admin    | `admin1`   | `password3` |
| Advisor  | `advisor1` | `password2` |
| User     | `user1`    | `password1` |

Each role is redirected to its own protected dashboard.

Authentication Flow (High Level)
--------------------------------

1.  User submits credentials via the login form
    
2.  Frontend sends a POST /auth/login request
    
3.  Backend validates credentials and returns:
    
    *   JWT token
        
    *   user id
        
    *   username
        
    *   role
        
4.  Frontend stores the token securely in localStorage
    
5.  HTTP interceptor automatically attaches: Authorization: Bearer
    
6.  Protected API calls are enabled
    
7.  User is redirected based on role
    

Role-Based Routing
------------------

Each role has access only to its own dashboard:

*   **Admin** → /admin
    
*   **Advisor** → /advisor
    
*   **User** → /user
    

Route access is enforced using:

*   AuthGuard (authentication)
    
*   RoleGuard (authorization)
    

Security Features
-----------------

### Token Interceptor

*   Automatically attaches JWT token to all outgoing HTTP requests
    

### Error Interceptor

*   Detects 401 / 403 responses
    
*   Automatically logs the user out
    
*   Redirects to /login
    
*   Ensures session consistency
    

### Token Expiration

*   Tokens expire on the backend
    
*   Expired sessions are handled gracefully
    
*   User is redirected to login when necessary
    

Architecture Overview
---------------------

src/app
├── auth
│ ├── auth.service.ts
│ ├── auth.guard.ts
│ ├── role.guard.ts
│ └── login/
├── interceptors

The architecture follows separation of concerns, making the application scalable and maintainable.

Tech Stack
----------

*   Angular 17
    
*   TypeScript
    
*   RxJS
    
*   JWT Authentication
    
*   GitHub Pages (Frontend hosting)
    
*   Render (Backend hosting)
    

Skills Demonstrated
-------------------

This project demonstrates practical experience with:

*   Enterprise Angular architecture
    
*   Secure frontend authentication
    
*   JWT lifecycle management
    
*   Role-based authorization
    
*   HTTP interceptors
    
*   Error handling strategies
    
*   Frontend–backend integration
    
*   Production deployment (GitHub Pages)
    
*   Cloud-based backend consumption (Render)
    

Why This Matters
----------------

This is not a tutorial project. It reflects patterns used in:

*   Banking applications
    
*   Admin dashboards
    
*   Internal enterprise tools
    
*   Fintech platforms
    

The same concepts apply directly to real production systems.

Final Notes
-----------

If the app appears unresponsive during login, please wait up to 1 minute and try again. This is due to backend cold starts on the free hosting tier. Once active, everything works instantly.

Thanks for reviewing this project!
